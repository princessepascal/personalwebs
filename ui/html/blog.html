<h4>5. Nowadays, there are over 700 different programming languages. All experts recommend for kids to start with a visual editor and a blockly based programming language for them to learn in a smoother and easier way.</h4>
<h4>6. The first programming language (per sé) was called Fortran, and it was created in the ’50s.</h4>
<h4>7. Almost any powered with electricity needs to be coded. Can you imagine?!</h4>
<h4>8. The word computer “bug” was inspired by a real bug. It was founded by Grace Hopper in 1947.</h4>
<h4>9. Since many programming languages share the same structure, it is easy for students to learn a new programming language once they have already mastered one before.</h4>
<h4>10. Computers run on binary code, which means that their software is written using only 1s and 0s</h4>
<h4>11. Learning coding has stunning cognitive-related benefits, such as problem-solving, computational thinking, analytical thinking, creative thinking, leadership-related skills, and even teamwork.</h4>
<h4>12. In the near future knowing how to code will be as necessary as knowing how to write is today. Yes, regardless of the field or career your students decide for their future.</h4>
